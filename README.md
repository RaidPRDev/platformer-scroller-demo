Updated in Visual C# 2017 using MonoGame 3.6 Framework ( 2018 )

This is a technical demonstration of a 2D platform game using the Monogame Framework.

Monogame is an open source an implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework.

This project was originally created in 2012 using XNA 3.0 Framework.  Unfortunatley, XNA is no longer supported by Microsoft.  

Thank you Monogame for keeping XNA alive.
