# 2D Platform Framework
Updated in Visual C# 2017 using MonoGame 3.6 Framework ( 2018 )

This is a basic 2d framework that serves as a technical demonstration for any kind of 2D game using the Monogame Framework.

Monogame is an open source an implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework.

This project was originally created in 2012 using XNA 3.0 Framework.  Unfortunatley, XNA is no longer supported by Microsoft.  

Thank you Monogame for keeping XNA alive.

# Features

**Scene Management** a combination levels, triggers and cutscenes.  

- Levels.  This gives use the ability to create and manage levels and cutscenes.  In doing so, we can add game objects to the scene via code.  When the game runs, it will systematically add the game objects according to the player's position and level.

- Cutscenes.  Using scene triggers we can create a sequence of sub scenes within out level at any point.

- Scene Triggers.  This will give us the option on when to add certain elements, such as enemies. We can tell the game exactly when this will occur.

**Audio Management** comes equipped with basic sound and music managers.

**Content Management** is a helper class that is included in Texture, Sound and Music Managers. Instead of manully adding you content in code, this will automatically load all the content from the foler that you specify.
